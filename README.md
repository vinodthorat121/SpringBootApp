# SpringBootApp

Schedule Management System
STEP 1 : Environment set up
To start from this repo
Git clone the repo
Launch eclipse and add the project
or you can recreate the project..

Steps to create project from scratch
In Eclipse you must first install some plugins.

Go to Help->Eclipse Marketplace->(search for the Spring and it will find all Spring plugins) -> Install(Spring Tool Suite, Spring Source Tool Suite).
Create new project-> Spring Boot ->Spring Starter Project
Name the project schms
Name the package com.schms
Next, choose Web package, MySQL package
Add those dependencies:
org.springframework.boot spring-boot-starter-jdbc org.springframework.boot spring-boot-starter-data-jpa org.springframework.boot spring-boot-starter-test test
STEP 2 : Working set up
After instalation there must be a generated project.
Use a MySQL Manager (MySQLBench, cli, or others), to generate the the database :
database name : schms
user : root
password : none
Find the SchmsApplication.java under the src folder
Right click, find Run As-> Spring Boot App. You should be able on the right side to see the server trying to run. It must show Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)
STEP 3 Some documentation : Spring Modules
Below a direct extract from Spring Doc

There are a number of modules in Spring Boot, here is a quick overview:

spring-boot
The main library providing features that support the other parts of Spring Boot, these include:

The SpringApplication class, providing static convenience methods that make it easy to write a stand-alone Spring Application. Its sole job is to create and refresh an appropriate Spring ApplicationContext
Embedded web applications with a choice of container (Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow)
First class externalized configuration support
Convenience ApplicationContext initializers, including support for sensible logging defaults
spring-boot-autoconfigure
Spring Boot can configure large parts of common applications based on the content of their classpath. A single @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation triggers auto-configuration of the Spring context.

Auto-configuration attempts to deduce which beans a user might need. For example, if HSQLDB is on the classpath, and the user has not configured any database connections, then they probably want an in-memory database to be defined. Auto-configuration will always back away as the user starts to define their own beans.

spring-boot-starters
Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. You get a one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technology that you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy paste loads of dependency descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and JPA for database access just include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in your project, and you are good to go.

spring-boot-cli
The Spring command line application compiles and runs Groovy source, making it super easy to write the absolute minimum of code to get an application running. Spring CLI can also watch files, automatically recompiling and restarting when they change.

spring-boot-actuator
Spring Boot Actuator provides additional auto-configuration to decorate your application with features that make it instantly deployable and supportable in production. For instance if you are writing a JSON web service then it will provide a server, security, logging, externalized configuration, management endpoints, an audit abstraction, and more. If you want to switch off the built in features, or extend or replace them, it makes that really easy as well.

spring-boot-loader
Spring Boot Loader provides the secret sauce that allows you to build a single jar file that can be launched using java -jar. Generally you will not need to use spring-boot-loader directly, but instead work with the link:spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-gradle-plugin[Gradle] or link:spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin[Maven] plugin.

Samples
Groovy samples for use with the command line application are available in link:spring-boot-cli/samples[spring-boot-cli/samples]. To run the CLI samples type spring run <sample>.groovy from samples directory.

Java samples are available in link:spring-boot-samples[spring-boot-samples] and should be built with maven and run by invoking java -jar target/<sample>.jar.

Guides
The http://spring.io/[spring.io] site contains several guides that show how to use Spring Boot step-by-step:

http://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/[Building an Application with Spring Boot] is a very basic guide that shows you how to create a simple application, run it and add some management services.
http://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/[Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring Boot Actuator] is a guide to creating a REST web service and also shows how the server can be configured.
http://spring.io/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/[Converting a Spring Boot JAR Application to a WAR] shows you how to run applications in a web server as a WAR file.
